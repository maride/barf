# BARF, or the Breakpoint-Assisted Rough Fuzzer, is a tool to do intelligent bruteforcing.
# The "intelligent" part comes from watching breakpoints and counting how often they were hit.
# Input is fed into the target program, character-wise, and the character with the best score wins. ;)
# This is done as long as there is a better score to get, and/or until a "win breakpoint" is hit.
# If that's hard to understand on the first read, see some of the examples. ;)
#
# This script is not designed to be directly called. Instead, it gets imported by gdb, via the -x argument.
# Because passing arguments into gdb-python scripts is not trivial, the script _should_ be called by the barf.sh wrapper.
# If you have any reasons to avoid the wrapper script, ... uh well. Your choice. You can call the barf.py script via gdb like this:
# gdb -nx -ex "py barf_positive_addr=False;barf_negative_addr='0x5555555551c0';barf_win_addr='0x5555555551ec';barf_known_prefix='';barf_known_suffix=''" -x barf.py ./beispiel1
#  -nx avoids loading .gdbinit
#  -ex throws your arguments into gdb-python (must be specified _before_ handing in the script
#  -x specifies the location of the script
#  after that comes your executable (./beispiel1 in this case)
#
# In doubt, see https://github.com/maride/barf
# Have fun with the script! :)
